Used to scrap HTML code for DnD 5e spell descriptions which I used in an Illustrator project to create my own spells cards. The script takes as input the list of spells (spell_list.txt) and outputs a CSV file, delimited by a semi-colon, containing all the relevent information (name, level, casting range, component cost, description, reference manual, and page number). Note: several spell descriptions have semi-colons but these text fields can be concatenated using, for example, excel.
